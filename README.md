# Solas 2 Drupal Patches

This repository is meant to collect all patches we apply to modules that are either not suitable for contribution on drupal.org or that will never be merged because of various reasons that can be attributed to the maintainer's choice. 

The repository is public to allow referencing the patches from the `solas2.make` file; patches must be referenced using their raw URL.
